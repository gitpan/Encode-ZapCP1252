Name
    Encode::ZapCP1252 - Zap Windows Western Gremlins

Synopsis
      use Encode::ZapCP152;

      zap_to_cp1252($text);

Description
    Have you ever been processing a Web form submit, assuming that the
    incoming text was encoded in ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1), only to end up with a
    bunch of junk because someone pasted in content from Microsoft Word?
    Well, this is because Microsoft uses a superset of the Latin-1 encoding
    called "Windows Western" or "CP1252". So mostly things will come out
    right, but a few things--like curly quotes, m-dashes, elipses, and the
    like--will not. The differences are well-known; you see a nice chart at
    documenting the differences on Wikipedia:
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252>.

    Of course, that won't really help you. What will help you is to quit
    using Latin-1 and switch to UTF-8. Then you can just convert from CP1252
    to UTF-8 without losing a thing, just like this:

      use Encode;
      $text = decode('cp1252', $text, 1);

    But I know that there are those of you out there stuck with Latin-1 and
    who don't want any junk charactrs from Word users, and that's where this
    module comes in. It will zap those CP1252 gremlins for you, turning them
    into their appropriate ASCII approximations.

Usage
    This module exports a single subroutine: "zap_cp1252()". You use it like
    this:

      zap_cp1252($text);

    This subroutine performs an *in place* conversion of the CP1252 gremlins
    into appropriate ASCII approximations.

    Note that because the conversion happens in place, the data to be
    converted *cannot* be a string constant; it must be a scalar variable.

Conversion Table
    Here's how the characters are converted to ASCII. They're not perfect
    conversions, but they should be good enough. If you want perfect, switch
    to UTF-8 and be done with it!
