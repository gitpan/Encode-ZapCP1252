Revision history for Perl extension Encode::ZapCP1252

0.30  2010-06-12T18:05:38
      - The conversion functions now ignore `undef` arguments and just return
        without doing anything.
      - Strings are no longer modifed in-place unless the conversion
        subroutines are called in a void context.
      - The conversion functions may optionally be called with no arugment
        when run in Perl 5.10 or higher, in which case they will instead act
        on `$_`.

      - Added `local` to examples of changing the maping tables.
      - When the Encode module is insatlled, zapping and fixing CP1252
        gremlins now works in decoded strings, too.
      - For convenience, the functions now return the strings they've
        modified.
      - Shipping with a traditional `Makefile.PL` rather than one that
        passes through to Module::Build.
      - Moved repository to [GitHub](http://github.com/theory/encode-zapcp1252).

      - Removed bogus test.out file from the distribution. No idea how that

      - Added `fix_cp1252()`, which converts CP1252 gremlins to their UTF-8
        equivalents.
      - Made the character mapping hashes into `our` variables, instead of
        lexicals, so that they can be messed with externally. Suggested by
        Max Maischen.
      - Added link to source code repository.
      - Now requiring Perl 5.6.2 or greater.
