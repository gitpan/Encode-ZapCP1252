Revision history for Perl extension Encode::ZapCP1252

0.11  2008-05-03T21:33:40
      - Removed bogus test.out file from the distribution. No idea how that
        got in there.
      - Added Module::Build to `build_requires` in Build.PL.
      - Fixed another Perl 5.6.2 test failure reported by David Golden.
      - Added Encode to the `recommends` parameter in Build.PL.

0.10  2008-05-02T18:32:27
      - Added `fix_cp1252()`, which converts CP1252 gremlins to their UTF-8
        equivalents.
      - Made the character mapping hashes into `our` variables, instead of
        lexicals, so that they can be messed with externally. Suggested by
        Max Maischen.
      - Added link to source code repository.
      - Now requiring Perl 5.6.2 or greater.

0.02  2008-05-02T04:50:04
